## Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis of a malware sample typically requires running it in a sandbox (e.g., a virtual machine with limited networking capabilities).

- Advanced malware may perform **sandbox detection** to resist dynamic analysis.

It's usually a good idea to utilize a mix of static and dynamic approaches. For example:

1. Running the malware in a sandbox first to get an overall idea about its behavior
1. Then diving into the - usually obfuscated - code to reveal hidden logic paths

## Practice

Follow the article on Remcos RAT infection at https://any.run/malware-trends/remcos/. Try to reproduce the results shown there.

## Exercise 4

1. Select a malware that you want to analyze from [TheZoo](https://https//github.com/ytisf/theZoo)

1. Upload the malware to a sandboxing solution like [ANY.RUN](https://any.run) or [Joe Sandbox](https://www.joesandbox.com/)

1. Explain the overall behavior of the malware:

   - Provide screenshots and explanations about relevant IoCs detected by the sandbox.

   - Try to explain a logical flow (story) of actions performed by the malware
   - Use the article from practice section as a guide.
